# Queue-data-structures
Console app designed to solve the following problem - A ticket company sells tickets (in advance) for popular events. Often all the tickets for
an event are sold, and then people can ask to be put on a waiting list. If someone who
has bought a ticket returns it, then the first person on the waiting list is informed and
can buy the ticket.

Write a program to maintain such waiting lists. It should offer the user a menu allowing
them to choose the following operations:<br>

• Print to the screen a list of the events for which there is a waiting list, and how
many people are currently on each list.

• Choose a particular waiting list and then, for this list, choose from the following
options (on a second menu):

– Prompt for the name and phone number of a person, and add that person to
the end of the waiting list.

– Delete the first person from the list (because a ticket is now available for them)
and print his or her name and phone number.

– Prompt for the name of a person, and then indicate how far down the waiting
list (e.g. position 1, position 6, etc.) that person is.

– Reset this waiting list to empty (because the event has taken place), and change
the name of the event associated with the list.

– Return to main menu.

• Quit program.
